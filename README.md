To change or apply new policies to datree, simply uncomment any line you want from the poicies.yaml file, a ``datree publish publish.yaml`` will run during the build steps in Github actions and loop through every folder to test both Kustimize files and regular k8s-manifest incase no Kustomize file exists.
